# EmotionDetector

This repository holds the files that were used for the Emotion Detector project by Stanly Gomes and Robin Buonya-Knul.

The dataset preprocessing for the GoEmotions dataset was done in the "GoEmotionProcessing.ipynb". The classification of the GoEmotions dataset was originally done in the "GoEmotionsClassification_Keras.ipynb", and was merged with the smaller dataset classification to the fully encompassing notebook for the classfication portion: "EmotionClassification_Keras.ipynb". 

The attempts at converting the code to PyTorch are labeled with the ending "pytorch.ipynb", but they are not in working condition.
